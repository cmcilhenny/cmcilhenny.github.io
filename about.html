			<h3 class="text-center">About Me</h3>
			<p class="lead text-center">I am a full stack web developer and recent General Assembly graduate. I am passionate about coding, problem solving and learning new technologies. I love the creative possiblities of code!</p>

			<p class="lead text-center">I have a broad experience in web development from Rails to AngularJS. </p>

			<p class="lead text-center">I like to spend my free time making things -- furniture, jewelry, homemade liquors, jams, kimchi, and now websites. I try to read a book a week (the Count of Monte Cristo took longer). Two years ago my new year's resolution was to eat more fruit and learn JavaScript. I don't eat more fruit, but am hooked on code. This is blog about the technologies I'm learning and loving.</p>
