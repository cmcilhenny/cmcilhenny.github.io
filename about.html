<h3 class="text-center">About Me</h3>
<p class="lead text-center">I am a full stack web developer and recent General Assembly graduate. I am passionate about coding, problem solving and learning new technologies. I love the creative possiblities of code!</p>

<p class="lead text-center">I have a broad experience in web development from Rails to AngularJS. </p>

<p class="lead text-center">I like to spend my free time making things -- furniture, jewelry, homemade liquors, jams, kimchi, and now websites. I try to read a book a week (the Count of Monte Cristo took longer). Two years ago my new year's resolution was to eat more fruit and learn JavaScript. I don't eat more fruit, but am hooked on code. <br>This is blog about the technologies I'm learning and loving. Check out some of my projects <a class="link" href="/projects.html">here.</a></p>

<h3 class="text-center">About This Site</h3>
<p class="lead text-center">This site was made using GitHub pages and Jekyll. It also uses AngularJS and Bootstrap for look and feel. <br>Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/cmcilhenny/cmcilhenny.github.io" class="link">here.</a></p>
