			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p class="lead">I am from the east coast, but love on the west coast. Since graduating college, I've worked for a variety of Art Museums. I like to spend my free time making things -- furniture, jewelry, homemade liquors, jams, kimchi. I hope to travel to Iceland some day and will most likely be listening to Hall & Oats on the plane there. I try to read a book a week (the Count of Monte Cristo took longer). Two years ago my new year's resolution was to eat more fruit and learn JavaScript. I don't eat more fruit, but am hooked on code. This is blog about the technologies I'm learning and loving.</p>

			<h3>Projects in the Wild</h3>
